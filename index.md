## About Me
I am a transmission planning engineer with hands-on experience supporting interconnection and grid reliability studies for inverter-based resources and HVDC systems in the United States. My work includes reactive power capability assessments, steady-state and dynamic simulations, and EMT-based studies using industry-standard tools such as PSCAD, PSS®E, and PowerFactory. I am particularly interested in HVDC stability, BESS integration, and grid modernization initiatives.
