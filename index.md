## About Me
I am a Power System Consultant with hands-on experience supporting grid integration of inverter based resources, including solar PV, battery energy storage (BESS), wind, hybrid, and HVDC systems. My expertise includes load flow, contingency, reactive power, power evacuation, and stability analyses using tools such as PSSE, PSCAD, PSLF and DIgSILENT PowerFactory.
I have supported interconnection and feasibility studies across major North American ISOs and regions, including ERCOT, CAISO, MISO, SPP, and WECC, working closely with developers and stakeholders throughout the study lifecycle. My work emphasizes technical rigor, regulatory compliance, and practical solutions to enable reliable, cost effective renewable energy integration.

### HVDC Reactive Power Compensation Study
**Objective:**
Assess system stability and control interactions for a point-to-point HVDC project.

**Scope & Work:**
-	Assess the reactive power capability of the HVDC project at the point of interconnection (POI) and verify its compliance with WECC’s reactive power requirement,
	Identify any additional requirement of reactive power compensation at the Substation considering different loading conditions in the WECC area and operation scenarios of the HVDC project.


**Tools:**
PSSE, Python
